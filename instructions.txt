Modifications necessary to connect to server & add a workout (currently hard-coded, not yet user-defined/modifiable)
  In Authmodel.js, change this:
    let currentIpAddress = '__here__:5000'; 
    replace __here__ with your IPV4, leave 5000 as the port#
    
  In createWorkoutScreen.jsx, change this:
    let currentIpAddress = '__here__:5000';
    replace __here__ with your IPV4


  To get the IP address:
    Windows:
      Window Key + R
      Type "cmd", press Enter
      Type "ipconfig" in Terminal, press Enter
      Copy the IPV4 Address and paste it in the files above
    Mac:
      Google it sorry, I have Windows lol

Commands to start the application:
  Main app:
    from the main folder run "npm start" (or "npx expo start", I think, npm start works for me)

  Server:
    from the main folder, in terminal type:
      "cd Backend", press Enter
      "nodemon server.js"  (This keeps the server running continuously and updates any changes in the server.js file automatically)

      You should see in the terminal:
        "Server running on port 5000"
        "MongoDB Connected" (after a few seconds)

With a fresh download from github I always had to install packages. The package.json file may have all the neccessary packages,
    or you may have to install some first (basically for all of the files when you see "import ... from '....'  at the top, you would have to run:
      "npm install '....'
